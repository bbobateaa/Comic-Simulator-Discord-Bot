# Comic-Simulator-Discord-Bot
I created a discord bot inspired by my dog Comic who is a total drama queen and by Tamagotchi games where you take care of your digital pet

The player's goal is to satisfy Comic's needs such as hunger and boredom but his satisfcation bars can go up or down dependening on what and how often you feed him. 

commands:

!feed [choice of food] = This feeds Comic and makes his hunger level go up depending on what you chose as the choice of food! (hint: he loves cheese)

!trick [choice of trick] = Comic will do the trick depending on how much he appreicates you as a human and whether you have food on you or not

still implementing on-going project
